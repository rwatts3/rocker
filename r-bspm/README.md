## Rocker r-bspm

The `r-bspm` Dockerfiles from the [Rocker Project](https://www.rocker-project.org/)
provide basic building blocks using Ubuntu and Debian with the
[bspm](https://cran.r-project.org/package=bspm) package to bridge from the R package
management to the system package manager.

Documentation is being added at the [Wiki](https://github.com/rocker-org/rocker/wiki). Please file
issue tickets at [the rocker/ issue tracker](https://github.com/rocker-org/rocker/issues).
